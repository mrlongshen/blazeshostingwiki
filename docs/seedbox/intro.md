After you complete your order, we assign you on the free slot. As soon as your account is created, you receive a welcome email with your login information, which includes name of assigned server, your username, and your password. An example would be this:

Assigned server: sb1.blazesbox.download
Username: blazesuser
Password: blazes123
The username is the same for both web and FTP (see the tutorials for information on accessing).
